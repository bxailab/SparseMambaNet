## Overview

This repository contains the code for the offline implementation of the EEG-based lie detection methods described in the paper "SparseMambaNet: A Novel Architecture Integrating Bi-Mamba and Mixture of Experts for Efficient EEG-Based Lie Detection". A demo to classify deception from scalp EEG signals during the CQT (Comparison Question Technique) task is provided.

## Installation

* **Python environment:** Set up a new conda environment `b2voice` using the provided `requirements.yml` as follows:

```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
This will install all the required Python packages to run this code (installation will take around 10-15 minutes). 

* **System requirements:** This code runs on a GPU for optimal performance. It has been tested on Linux (22.04 LTS) with RTX 4090 GPU. 

## Data
The EEG dataset is not publicly available due to privacy concerns.
